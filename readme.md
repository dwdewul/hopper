This is a sample game created partially by me. The resources and engine files were provided by Udacity in their Front-end Engineer Nanodegree program. Most of the code written in the app.js file was written by me to make all of the actual functionality of the game (movement, etc.) work. 

I left the instructions for game play in the index.html. Please let me know if you have any questions!
